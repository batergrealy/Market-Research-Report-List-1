<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Duct Smoke Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Photoelectric</li><li>Ionization</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Duct smoke detectors are essential for fire safety in HVAC systems, detecting smoke within ductwork. The market is primarily divided into two types: photoelectric and ionization detectors. Photoelectric detectors use a light source and a sensor to identify smoke particles, making them effective for smoldering fires. Ionization detectors utilize radioactive material to sense ionized particles from flaming fires, responding quickly to fast-burning flames. Both types play crucial roles in enhancing safety by providing early warning in commercial and residential settings.</p></p>
